## 🎯 Project Goal  

Explore how players engage with different games, how many convert to paying users, and which titles generate the most revenue.  
The project focuses on:
- User engagement over time (DAU, WAU)
- Conversion from free to paying users
- Revenue quality (ARPPU, paying user structure)
- Differences between games, age groups, and devices  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Methods  

- **Google Sheets** – data cleaning, KPI calculations, custom formulas  
- **Pivot Tables** – cohort analysis, segmentation by game / device / age  
- **Charts & Dashboards** – to visualize trends and patterns:
  - line charts for engagement
  - combo charts for DAU / WAU
  - bar charts for languages & cohorts
  - 3D pie charts for device distribution

## 📈 Key Metrics Tracked  

- **Ad Spend & Total Revenue** – efficiency of marketing spend  
- **CR to Paid** – how many active users convert to paying  
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)** – quality of monetization  
- **Age Distribution of Payers** – which groups bring the most revenue  
- **DAU & WAU** – short- and mid-term engagement  

---

## 🔍 Insights & Interpretation  

- Some games show **low CR to Paid**, which may indicate:
  - weak ad targeting
  - low perceived value of in-game purchases
  - friction in the payment flow  

- **ARPPU differences** between games hint at:
  - content quality and depth
  - value of in-game items / bundles
  - pricing and discount strategy  

- Engagement and cohort charts suggest that:
  - better onboarding and early-game experience can improve retention
  - time-limited offers and events may increase both activity and revenue  

---

## 📌 Possible Next Steps  

- Run **user surveys** to understand what features players value  
- Compare results with **competitor games** and benchmarks  
- A/B test:
  - different paywalls and bundles
  - reward structures (daily bonuses, streaks)
  - changes in ad placement and frequency
